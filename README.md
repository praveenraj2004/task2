Smart Grid Energy Management System

Overview

The Smart Grid Energy Management System (SGEMS) is designed to optimize the production, distribution, and consumption of electrical energy. It aims to enhance energy efficiency, reduce costs, and improve the reliability of the electrical grid by integrating advanced metering infrastructure, demand response capabilities, and renewable energy sources.

Features

Real-Time Monitoring: Track energy usage and generation in real-time. Demand Response: Automatically adjust energy consumption based on demand and supply conditions. Renewable Integration: Seamlessly integrate solar, wind, and other renewable energy sources. Energy Storage Management: Optimize the use of battery storage systems. User Dashboard: User-friendly interface for consumers to monitor and control their energy usage. Predictive Analytics: Use machine learning to forecast energy demand and supply. Alerts and Notifications: Get notified about critical events and system status.

Prerequisites

Python 3.8+: Ensure you have Python installed. Virtual Environment: Recommended for dependency management. Flask: Web framework for the user dashboard. pandas: Data analysis and manipulation tool. matplotlib: Plotting library for visualizing data. sklearn: Machine learning library for predictive analytics.

Configuration

Database: Configure your database settings in config.py. API Keys: Store your API keys for external services (e.g., weather data) in config.py. Model Training: Scripts for training machine learning models are located in the models/ directory.

Usage

Real-Time Monitoring: Access the user dashboard to view real-time data on energy consumption and generation. Demand Response: Configure demand response settings to automate energy savings during peak demand times. Renewable Integration: Add and monitor renewable energy sources through the dashboard. Energy Storage: Manage battery storage to ensure optimal energy use and savings. Predictive Analytics: Use the built-in predictive analytics to forecast energy needs and adjust accordingly. Alerts: Set up alerts to stay informed about important system events and conditions.

Troubleshooting

Application Errors: Check the logs for detailed error messages. Database Issues: Ensure your database is properly configured and accessible. API Problems: Verify that your API keys are correctly set up and have the necessary permissions.
